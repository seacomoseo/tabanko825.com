      Tabanko 825 is a restaurant with a gastronomy that fuses the typical cuisine of CÃ¡diz and Murcia, mixing modernity and tradition.

      Here you can enjoy the authentic almadraba tuna (one of our specialties) accompanied by our great selection of wines.

      All this, surrounded by a very rogue atmosphere.
