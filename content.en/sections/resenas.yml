      We went on the recommendation of some friends and it was a real discovery.

      A little piece of Cadiz in Murcia, that is, the menu is not very extensive but includes most of the hits of Cadiz cuisine.

      Everything we tasted was quality product with an exquisite elaboration.

      If to the good food we add the friendliness of the service makes it a place to repeat many times.

      Another notch in our notebook of getting to know new restaurants.

      Tonight we went to Tabanko 825, which is a little corner of Cadiz in Murcia.

      In a small but cozy place (there is also a terrace), they serve you with great friendliness and professionalism. A 10 for the service.

      And the dishes were delicious.

      We started with some shrimp omelettes, boletus croquettes and coquinas.

      We continued with marinated dogfish and almadraba tuna tartar. All this washed down with a few thirds of cold beer and a few glasses of fino de Jerez.

      Culminated with a chocolate and carrot coulant for my wife... And what fits me best, the cheese tart from the Sierra de CÃ¡diz: "You're like a goat".

      We will be back, for sure.

      A corner of Cadiz in the center of Murcia.

      It is an intimate place with lots of charm with an unbeatable treatment to the product.

      The tuna is the center of many elaborations and all are an authentic experience.

      Highly recommended.

      A very pleasant surprise.

      The truth is, I can't put a single negative word against anything.

      The treatment very good and the food of 10.

      If you are looking for a place to eat well, elaborate and with a good value for money, this is your place.

      We let ourselves be guided by the waiter and the truth is that we were delighted.

      Highly recommended.

      We loved it!

      We will definitely repeat.

      We had been wanting to go in for a long time and it has been a pleasant surprise.

      Both the attention from the owner, as the variety of the menu and the quality of the raw material, different types of Levante star on tap, a great variety of vermouth and wines.

      The place is very cozy and the decoration is very nice.

      I am allergic to seafood and they have cooked me croquettes apart, they do not usually have the detail in almost any place (the best ones are the ones of cocido ðŸ™‚).

      Highly recommended and original vermouth cocktail, super good Russian salad and tomato and quince tartar.

      The dessert was spectacular! Next time we will try the meat that looked very good.

      Very good price, totally according to the service and quality.

      We had a meal with friends and the atmosphere, the service and the food were unbeatable.

      All the dishes we decided to try were very good with an adjusted quality-price ratio.

      It has a terrace or tables inside.
